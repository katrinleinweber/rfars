## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Downsized the vignettes to reduce the check time.

* Removed the words that were triggering the misspelling note.

* Rephrased the Description to not begin with 'this package'

* Removed some unnecessary content from Readme.

* Removed a function and dependency that is no longer required.
