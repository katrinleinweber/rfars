Description: This package downloads raw data from the National 
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA's) Fatality 
    Analysis Reporting System (FARS) File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 
    site, cleans and decodes it according to an included data 
    dictionary, and saves the resulting data tables to the user's 
    hard drive. Exposure data (VMT, etc.) is included at various 
    geographic scales. Functions facilitate high-level analysis 
    including custom crash counts and rates, exploratory analysis 
    of user-specified crashes and the people involved in them, and 
    hotspot mapping.
